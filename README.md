## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Francois (Fran) Botha. 

I am a seasoned IT professional with over a decade of experience in IT management, technical engineering, and team leadership. I excel at aligning IT strategies with business goals, driving innovation, and ensuring operational excellence. My expertise includes managing complex enterprise environments, maintaining compliance with industry standards, and optimizing system performance. I have a proven track record of leading cross-functional teams, providing comprehensive support, and implementing effective migrations and rollouts. I am skilled in cost-efficient IT operations, risk management, and integrating advanced technologies. My focus is on delivering client-centered solutions, enhancing service delivery, and maintaining robust IT infrastructures across various industries.

In addition to my professional expertise, I have a foundation in programming (Python, C#, Java), gained through my academic background and personal initiatives. While not a professional software developer, I am proficient in HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript, having taught myself these skills out of a passion for software development. Currently, I am learning how to proficiently use NuxtJS and VueJS to further expand my skills, leveraging my well-rounded knowledge of databases and database systems to empower myself in progressive web application development. This fascination drives me to continuously expand my knowledge and take on small coding projects. I am dedicated to further enhancing my programming abilities, with the goal of creating meaningful solutions that can someday positively impact users. This eagerness to learn and innovate complements my IT management capabilities, allowing me to bring a well-rounded approach to every project I undertake.
